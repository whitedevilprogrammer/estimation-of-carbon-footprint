        <p id="gradient1">A carbon footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities, such as energy consumption, transportation, industrial processes, and deforestation. It serves as a critical measure of an individual's or organization's impact on climate change and global warming. Reducing one's carbon footprint has become increasingly important as the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change.To mitigate the adverse effects of carbon footprints, individuals, businesses, and governments must take concerted action. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can significantly reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation. Energy-efficient technologies and practices, including LED lighting and improved insulation, can further curtail energy consumption.</p>

        <p id="gradient1">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.

            The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
            
            Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.</p>
